# Key Takeways
* Errors are the way the computer communicates with you regarding your code.
* You're never going to stop making errors, its a normal part of programming.
* To solve the errors, just scroll to the top, and try fixing __only__ the first one.
  * Just hit the run button to check if you have fixed it!

# Video Addendum

You may have noticed that there was a `\n` at the end of the example on Repl.
That is how you add a new line (enter key in MS Word). Try adding and removing `\n` and seeing you notice a difference. `std::endl` can also be used to print out a new line. In general, we prefer using
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello world";
std::cout << std::endl;
```
over using
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello world\n";
```
