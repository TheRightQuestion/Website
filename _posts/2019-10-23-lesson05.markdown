# Key Takeways

# Video Addendum
Its possible to create a variable without assigning to it. In that case the value of the variable is unknown. We represent this using a `?` in our memory table.
For example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x;
    std::cout << "The initial value of X is: " << x << std::endl;
    x = 100;
    std::cout << "The final value of X is: " << x << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

There's no gaurantee what the initial value of X is. It might be 0, it might be 1234, or any other number. Hence why we refer to it as a `?` in our memory table when we create the variable using `int x;`. If we had done `int x = 100;` Then we would have created it with the value of `100` assigned to it. Its perfectly valid to have a variable not have an initial value if you'll be filling it in later either from user input or another function. 

BUT, if you ever find you are reading from a value that is a `?` in your memory table, you probably have a bug in your code!
