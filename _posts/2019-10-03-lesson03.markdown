# Video Addendum

# Assignment
* Create memory tables for adder assignment from Lesson02. Make sure you use different inputs as test cases in this memory table.
* Find two **whole number** values for which your calculator doesn't work.
  * Can you change the code to make it work for those values? Why or why not?
  * Are there two more values for this new calculator doesn't work? Why or why not?
* What is 2<sup>64</sup>? Try using an online calculator to check and then write it down by hand.
That's how large an `unsigned long long` can get!
* For each of the following types, come up with 5 real world examples when you would use them. Write these down along with a sentance for each explaining why that type is appropriate.
  * bool
  * unsigned short
  * int
  * unsigned long long
* Fill out the table until you can recognize the values off the tip of your tongue. **NO CALCULATORS**
