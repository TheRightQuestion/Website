# Key Takeways
`For` loops and `while` loops perform virtually the same task. The main difference of which to use when really comes down to semantics. Anything you can do with a `for` loop, you can do with a `while` loop. Anything you can do with a `while` loop, you can do with a `for` loop. Typically, most people use a `while` loop when you aren't sure when to end the loop.

## For Loops
The `for` loop looks like the following:
```cpp
for (int x = 0; x < 10; x+=1) {
    // body
}
```
Take note of the **semicolons** that break down the 3 parts of the for loop. 
1. `int x = 0` : **Loop initialization**. Here, you define the variable used in the loop. Note, a variable defined here is only defined in the scope of the `for` loop. It's not available after the `for` loop terminates.
2. `x < 10` : **Terminal Condition**. Like the `while` and `if`, this is the condition you want to stop the `for` loop at. This is checked everytime before the body is executed.
3. `x+=1` : **Increment**. At the bottom of a `while` loop you would increment the loop variable. The `for` expression formalizes it as a part of the definition so you don't accidentlly skip it.

The `for` above is exactly the same as the `while` code below:
```cpp
int x = 0;
while(x < 10) {
    // body
    x++;
}
```

Notice, while both of those code segements are doing the same thing there is 1 major difference. The variable `x` goes out of scope in the `for` loop, but in the `while`, it is available after the `while` has terminated.

## Using for vs while
One of the most common examples for using a `while` loop is when the terminating condition is based on a user input. Take a look at this code:
```cpp
int Guess() {
    std::cout << "Enter a guess: ";
    int number;
    std::cin >> number;
    return number;
}

int main() {
    int magic_number = 15;
    int guess = Guess();
    while (guess != magic_number) {
        std::cout << "Try again! ";
        guess = Guess();
    }
    std::cout << "That's it!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

<details><summary>What is the the maximum number of times the Guess function be called?</summary>You can't actually know! What if the user always enters the exact same guess every single time?</details><br />

With `for` loops, its good practice to use them when you know what the start and end conditions are and exactly how many times you will go through the loop.
```cpp
void PrintBox(int size) {
    for (int i=0; i < size; i++) {
        char horizontal = ' ';
        char vertical = '|';
        
        if (i == 0 || i == size - 1) {
            horizontal = '_';
        }

        if (i == 0) {
            vertical = ' ';
        }

        std::cout << vertical;
        for (int j=0; j < size; j++) {
            std::cout << horizontal;
        }
        std::cout << vertical << std::endl;
    }
}
```
Written with `while`, the same code is: 
```cpp
void PrintBox(int size) {
    int i = 0;
    while (i < size) {
        char horizontal = ' ';
        char vertical = '|';
        
        if (i == 0 || i == size - 1) {
            horizontal = '_';
        }

        if (i == 0) {
            vertical = ' ';
        }

        std::cout << vertical;
        int j = 0;
        while (j < size) {
            std::cout << horizontal;
            j++;
        }
        std::cout << vertical << std::endl;

        i++;
    }
}
```
Personally, I find the `for` statement to be much better to read and it keeps the scope of both the `i` and `j` variable to only the `for` loop! Do you agree?

## Infinite For Loops
Remeber how the following code never terminates?
```cpp
int counter = 0;
while(true) {
    std::cout << counter << std::endl;
    counter++;
}
```
We could write the same code in our `for` loop:
```cpp
for (int counter = 0; ; counter++) {
    std::cout << counter << std::endl;
}
```
While this is valid code, this is **NOT** good code! If you don't want a termination condition, consider using the `while` code above. Similarly, you can remove any of the 3 parts of the `for` loop and the code will still compile as long as you have the 2 semicolons.

# Assignment
1. Find the bug in the sample codes below and improve the code to the best of your ability.
1. For each code assignment in lesson 09, transfrom all of your while loops to for loops. Which work better as for loops? Which work better as while loops? If you think its not possible to write the code as a for loop, explain why.
2. Write a calculator which continuously asks the user for numbers and operators until the user finally enters the `=` operator. For example, your code should be able to produce the answer for both `5 + 1 =` and also `12 / 12 - 4 * 3 - 9 + 89 =`. Think carefully about if this is a for loop or while loop?
