# Key Takeways

# Video Addendum

# Assignment
* Work through the memory tables for both of your past assignments from Lesson01.
* For each of the code samples below:
    0. **DO NOT RUN THE CODE YET**
    1. Work through the memory table.
    2. Write what your program is doing in a sentence.
    3. Write what you think the program will output in console.
    4. Run the code in a new Repl to check your memory tables & outputs.
 * Create a new Repl where you request 2 numbers from the user, and then display their sum.

# Code Samples

{% capture sample-0 %}

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int first = 100;
  int second = 2450;
  float third = 100.0;
  std::cout << "First number is: " << first << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Second number is: " << second << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Third number is: " << third << std::endl;

  first = first + second * 2;
  second = second + 50;
  third = third / second;
  std::cout << "First number is: " << first << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Second number is: " << second << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Third number is: " << third << std::endl;
  
  first = second / first;
  third = first / third;
  std::cout << "First number is: " << first << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Second number is: " << second << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Third number is: " << third << std::endl;
}
```

  second = second + 50;
  third = third / second;

  std::cout << "Second number is: " << second << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Third number is: " << third << std::endl;
