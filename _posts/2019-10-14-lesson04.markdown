# Key Takeways

# Video Addendum
the `%` symbol is used for the mod operator. `a % b` would return the remainder after a is divided by b. 
For example: `14 % 5` is `4`. and `3 % 10` is is `3`.

# Assignment
* For each of the code samples below
    1. Describe what you think is wrong with the code (This means write it down in complete sentences!).
    2. Confirm your hypothesis by building a memory table
    3. Double check your work by trying to run the code in an example Repl.
* Currently your calculator asks the user for two numbers. Create a new repl, where you have a calulator that asks for both 2 numbers and one of the following operators `+ - * / %`. It should then print out the result.
    * **After** you've finished that, upgrade your calulator again to ask it for 3 numbers and 2 operator. Be sure to also print out the result not only at the end, but after each operator!
    * What about 4 numbers and 3 operators?
    * What about 5 numbers and 4 operators?
    * Did you notice any patterns as to what you were doing? Try describing what you think the pattern is (This means write it down in complete sentences!).
    * Note: Do **NOT** worry about order of operations.
